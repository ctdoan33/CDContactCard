# contactCardStarter

Here's where we left off with Contact Card this morning. We talked about dynamically generated content and why we need the .on() method

Then we also talked about this. As in THIS. As in this particular thing that's triggering the function.

At the moment, the whole entire card disappears when you click on it, your job is to figure out how to make it show its description instead!
